# Oscar Room Lighting
Creating automated lighting systems for Oscar's tiny room.
## Initial Intentions For This Project
### Potential Lighting Systems
* Automated color temperature changing with bed position
* Accent lighting turning on and off with bed position, over record player, maybe on top of shelf
* Def moving disco ball, but not necessarily with bed position 
  * Maybe using a remote that also has ir, 3d print clip under desk to hold it
* Spotlight for discoball for sure
